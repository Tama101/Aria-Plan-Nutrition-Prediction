# Aria Plant Nutrition Prediction

This study focuses on predicting plant nutrition using the Random Forest Regressor as the best estimator in the AdaBoost Regressor algorithm. The research aims to determine the best-fit model for both the training and testing datasets, by comparing the performance of different algorithms. The results show that the Random Forest Regressor achieved the highest accuracy in predicting plant nutrition, with a mean squared error (MSE) of X for the training set and Y for the testing set. These findings suggest that the Random Forest Regressor is a promising algorithm for accurately predicting plant nutrition, which can be useful for improving crop yield and optimizing fertilizer use.
